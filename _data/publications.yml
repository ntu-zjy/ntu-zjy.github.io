  title: "Enhancing Federated Domain Adaptation with Multi-Domain Prototype-Based Federated Fine-Tuning"
  venue: ICLR, 2025
  description: "MPFT is a novel Federated Domain Adaptation framework that fine-tunes a pre-trained model using multi-domain prototypes enriched with domain-specific local data to significantly improve in-domain and out-of-domain accuracy while converging in a single communication round, reducing computational and communication costs, and ensuring privacy through differential privacy and robustness against feature space hijacking attacks."
